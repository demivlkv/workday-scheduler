# Project 5: Third Party APIs Challenge - Work Day Scheduler
The goal for this project was to create a simple calendar application with dynamically updated HTML & CSS as the foundation, powered by jQuery. This work day planner allows users to save events throughout their work day, hence, displays each hour of a typical work day (7am-5pm). The user will not lose their input after saving, and will see their saved entries upon page refresh.

This project was built with:
- Bootstrap
- jQuery
- Moment.js
