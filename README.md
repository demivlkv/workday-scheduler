# Project 5: Third Party APIs Challenge - Work Day Scheduler
The goal for this project was to create a simple calendar application for users, with HTML & CSS as the foundation and powered by jQuery. This work day planner allows users to save events throughout their work day, hence, displays each hour of a typical work day (7am-5pm).

This project was built with:
- Bootstrap
- jQuery
- Moment.js
